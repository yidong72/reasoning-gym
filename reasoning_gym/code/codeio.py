You are given a question that requires some input and output variables as follows:

The input and output requirements are as follows:

Given the following input:

{2}

Can you predict the output without writing any code? Please think and then provide the exact output in the form of a JSON object as your final answer. The keys and values of the object should strictly match the output requirement as specified.

Tip: Here is a reference code snippet for this question. You can refer to this code to guide your reasoning but not copy spans of code directly.
