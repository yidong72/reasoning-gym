QUESTION_TEMPLATE = """There are several letter cards, and the game rules are as follows:
1. Initially, there are 13 cards.
2. Each time, a new card is added, and a result is determined. Then, one card is removed.
3. When there are two identical cards in hand, and the newly added card is the same as these two cards, the result is determined as "Peng".
4. If there are two cards in hand such that the new card can form a consecutive letter sequence with these two cards, the result is determined as "Chi". For example: ABC, BCD, CDE, etc.
5. If the new card does not meet the conditions of 3 and 4, the result is determined as "Pass".
6. "Peng" takes precedence over "Chi".
7. The card that is removed does not affect the result determination of the current round.

Example:
- Input: Given the initial cards ABBCCDDEEFFGH, what is the result at the end of performing the following rounds of operations:
Round 1: Add a B card and remove an E card.
Round 2: Add a C card and remove an H card.
Round 3: Add an E card and remove a D card.
Round 4: Add a D card and remove an F card.
- Output: Chi

Now, given the initial cards {cards}, what is the result at the end of performing the following rounds of operations:
