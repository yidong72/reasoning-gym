  "question": "Benny saw a 10-foot shark with 2 6-inch remoras attached to it. What percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras?",
  "answer": "First, find the combined length of the remoras in inches: 6 inches/remora * 2 remoras = <<6*2=12>>12 inches\nThen divide that number by 12 to convert it to feet: 12 inches / 12 inches/foot = <<1=1>>1 foot\nThen divide the combined remora length in feet by the shark's length and multiply by 100% to express the answer as a percentage: 1 foot / 10 feet * 100% = 10%\n#### 10",
