  "question": "When Sophie watches her nephew, she gets out a variety of toys for him. The bag of building blocks has 31 blocks in it. The bin of stuffed animals has 8 stuffed animals inside. The tower of stacking rings has 9 multicolored rings on it. Sophie recently bought a tube of bouncy balls, bringing her total number of toys for her nephew up to 62. How many bouncy balls came in the tube?",
  "answer": "Let T be the number of bouncy balls in the tube.\nAfter buying the tube of balls, Sophie has 31 + 8 + 9 + T = 48 + T = 62 toys for her nephew.\nThus, T = 62 - 48 = <<62-48=14>>14 bouncy balls came in the tube.\n#### 14",
