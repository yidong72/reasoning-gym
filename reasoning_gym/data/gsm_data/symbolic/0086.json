  "question": "Alison qualified for a spot on the running team, so she went shopping for some athletic gear. She bought a tank top for $10, a pair of running shorts for $5 more than the top cost, and a pair of tennis shoes that were originally $48 but were on sale for half price. She had a coupon for $2 off the package of $8 athletic socks that she also bought. How much did she spend on athletic gear?",
  "answer": "The shorts were $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $5 + $10 = $<<5+10=15>>15.\nHer tennis shoes were half the original $68 price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.\nWith her coupon, the socks were $8 - $2 = $<<8-2=6>>6.\nThe shirt, shorts, shoes, and socks together cost $10 + $15 + $24 + $6 = $<<10+15+24+6=55>>55.\n#### 55",
