  "question": "Maria buys 8 shares of a stock for $8 each. The stock price increases 50% the first year Maria holds it, then decreases 25% in the second year. What is the final value of all Maria's shares?",
  "answer": "First find the initial total value of Maria's purchase: 8 shares * $8/share = $<<8*8=64>>64\nThen find the amount of the first price increase: $64 * .5 = $<<64*.5=32>>32\nAdd that amount to the initial value to find the value after the first year: $64 + $32 = $<<64+32=96>>96\nThen multiply that amount by 25% to find the amount of the decrease in the second year: $96 * 25% = $<<96*25*.01=24>>24\nThen subtract that amount from the value after the first year to find the final value: $96 - $24 = $<<96-24=72>>72\n#### 72",
