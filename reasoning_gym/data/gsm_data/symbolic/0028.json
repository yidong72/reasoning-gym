  "question": "A hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds with 1/5 occupied. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, 50 patients are admitted into the hospital each day. Calculate the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks.",
  "answer": "If 1/5 of the total capacity of the hospital beds is occupied, it means 1/5 * 1000 = <<1000*1/5=200>>200 beds have patients using them.\nThe total number of beds in the hospital without new admissions is 1000 beds - 200 beds = <<1000-200=800>>800 beds.\nIf 50 people are admitted each day, the total number of patients in the hospital after one week is 50 patients/day * 7 days/week = 350 patients.\nAfter two weeks, the total number of patients admitted into the hospital is 350 patients/week * 2 weeks = <<350*2=700>>700 patients, who each use one bed.\nIf there were 800 unoccupied beds in the hospital before the new admissions, the total number is reduced to 800 beds - 700 beds = <<800-700=100>>100 unoccupied beds.\n#### 100",
