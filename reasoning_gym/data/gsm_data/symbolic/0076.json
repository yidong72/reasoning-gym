  "question": "Deandre caught 3 tunas last Monday, the first tuna he caught weighs 56 kilograms, the second tuna he caught weighs 46 kilograms, and the last tuna he caught weighs 26 kilograms. If a kilogram of tuna costs $0.50, how much will he earn after selling all the tunas to the market?",
  "answer": "Deandre will earn 56 x $0.50 = $<<56*0.5=28>>28 from the first tuna.\nHe will earn 46 x $0.50 = $<<46*0.5=23>>23 for the second tuna.\nAnd he will earn 26 x $0.50 = $<<26*0.5=13>>13 from the third tuna.\nTherefore, the total amount he will earn for all the tunas is $28 + $23 + $13= $<<28+23+13=64>>64.\n#### 64",
