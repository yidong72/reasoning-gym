  "answer": "First find the total number of puppies: 8 puppies + 12 puppies = <<8+12=20>>20 puppies\nThen find the total number of puppies with spots: 3 puppies + 4 puppies = <<3+4=7>>7 puppies\nThen divide the number of spotted puppies by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100% to find the percentage of puppies with spots: 7 puppies / 20 puppies * 100% = 35%\n#### 35",
