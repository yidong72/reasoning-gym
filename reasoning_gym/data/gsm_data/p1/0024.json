  "question": "According to its nutritional info, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories?",
  "answer": "If the total calorie target is 2000 and I have consumed 1800 calories then I have 2000-1800 = <<2000-1800=200>>200 calories left to eat\nIf each serving of chips has 250 calories and I only have 200 calories left to eat, then I can only eat 200/250 of a serving = 4/5 of a serving\nWe also know that a 300g bag of chips has 5 servings, hence each serving has 300g/5 = <<300/5=60>>60 grams\nIf I can only eat 4/5 of a serving, then I can eat only 60g * 4/5 = 240g/5 = 48 grams\n#### 48",
