  "question": "A plague infects ten people. Every day, each infected person infects six others. How many people are infected after three days?",
  "answer": "On the first day, the original ten people infect six people each, so 10 * 6 = <<10*6=60>>60 more people are infected.\nThere are 10 + 60 = <<10+60=70>>70 infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, 70 * 6 = <<70*6=420>>420 more people are infected.\nThere are 70 + 420 = <<70+420=490>>490 infected people after the second day.\nOn the third day, 490 * 6 = 2940 more people are infected. Therefore, there are 490 + 2940 = 3430 infected people after three days.\n#### 3430",

  "answer_annotated": "On the first day, the original {n0} people infect {r} people each, so {n0}*{r}=<<{n0}*{r}={n0*r}>>{n0*r} more people are infected.\nThere are {n0}+{n0*r}=<<{n0}+{n0*r}={n0+n0*r}>>{n0+n0*r} infected people after the first day.\nOn the second day, {n0+n0*r}*{r}=<<{n0+n0*r}*{r}={(n0+n0*r)*r}>>{(n0+n0*r)*r} more people are infected.\nThere are {n0+n0*r}+{(n0+n0*r)*r}=<<{n0+n0*r}+{(n0+n0*r)*r}={n0+n0*r+(n0+n0*r)*r}>>{n0+n0*r+(n0+n0*r)*r} infected people after the second day.\nWe see that every day, the amount of infected people will be multiplied by {r+1} (from {n0} to {n0*(r+1)} to {n0*(r+1)*(r+1)}). So, we will have {n0 * (r + 1)**d} infected people after {d} days.\n#### {n0 * (r + 1)**d}"
