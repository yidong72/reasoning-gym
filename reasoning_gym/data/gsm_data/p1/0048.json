  "question": "Emily can peel 6 shrimp a minute and saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. How long will it take her to peel and cook 90 shrimp?",
  "answer": "First find how long it takes Emily to peel the shrimp: 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = <<90/6=15>>15 minutes\nThen find how many batches of shrimp she needs to cook: 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp/batch = <<90/30=3>>3 batches\nThen multiply the number of batches by the time per batch to find the total cook time: 3 batches * 10 minutes/batch = <<3*10=30>>30 minutes\nThen add the peeling time to find the total time Emily spends: 30 minutes + 15 minutes = <<30+15=45>>45 minutes\n#### 45",
