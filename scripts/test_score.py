answer = """<think>Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, we have this A::B system with four tokens: A#, #A, B#, and #B. The rules are about rewriting neighboring tokens based on their facing #s. The goal is to compute the final state of the given program by applying these rules step by step until no more rules can be applied.

The input program is: A# A# #A B# B# B# A# A# #B A#

Hmm. Let me write this out as a sequence to visualize better. The tokens are in order:

1. A#

2. A#

3. #A

4. B#

5. B#

6. B#

7. A#

8. A#

9. #B

10. A#

Now, I need to process this sequence by looking for any pairs of adjacent tokens where the #s are facing each other. The rules are:

- A# followed by #A → remove them.

- A# followed by #B → swap to #B A#.

- B# followed by #A → swap to #A B#.

- B# followed by #B → remove them.

The processing is done by checking each possible pair in each step and applying the first applicable rule. But how exactly do the steps proceed? Do we scan from left to right each time, applying the first possible pair, then restart the scan? Or do we process all possible pairs in one pass? The example given in the problem might help clarify.

In the example provided, the steps were:

Original program: B# A# #B #A B#

Step 1: Replaced A# #B with #B A#, resulting in B# #B A# #A B#

Step 2: Replaced B# #B with nothing, resulting in A# #A B#

Step 3: Replaced A# #A with nothing, leading to B#.

So, in the first step, the pair A# #B (positions 2 and 3) were replaced. Then, after that replacement, in the new sequence, the first applicable pair was B# #B (positions 1 and 2?), which were removed. Then the next pair is A# #A (positions 1 and 2 now) and those are removed, leaving B#.

So, the approach seems to be that in each step, you look for the leftmost possible pair that can be rewritten, apply the rule, and then repeat the process from the beginning of the new sequence. Because after each replacement, the structure changes, and previous pairs might not exist anymore, so you have to start scanning again from the left.

Therefore, the algorithm would be:

1. Start from the left of the current sequence.

2. Check each pair of adjacent tokens.

3. For the first pair that matches any rule, apply the replacement.

4. If a replacement was applied, restart the scan from the beginning of the new sequence.

5. Repeat until no more pairs can be replaced.

So, applying this to the given problem.

Let me write down the initial sequence step by step and process it.

Initial sequence: [A#, A#, #A, B#, B#, B#, A#, A#, #B, A#]

Let's go through the steps:

First, check from left to right for any applicable pair.

Looking at the first two tokens: A# followed by A#. The next token is A#. So pair 1 and 2: A# and A#. Neither of them have a # facing each other. The first token is A#, second is A#, so their #s are on the right and left? Wait, A# is a token where the # is on the right. So the first A# has # on the right. The next A# also has # on the right. So their adjacent sides are A and #. Wait, no. Wait, each token is a symbol followed by # or # followed by a symbol. So A# is 'A' followed by a #. So when two A# tokens are next to each other, the first's right side is #, and the next's left side is A. So they are A# and A#. The first's right is #, the second's left is A. So the adjacent symbols are # and A. So they don't form a pair where the #s are facing each other.

So pair 1 and 2 (A# and A#) don't match any rule. Then check pair 2 and 3: A# followed by #A. Wait, the second token is A#, third is #A. So the right of A# is #, and the left of #A is #. Wait, no. Wait, the structure is that each token has a # either on the left or right. So the tokens are:

A# is [A][#], so the right side is #. The next token is #A, which is [#][A], so the left side is #. So when A# is followed by #A, the #s are adjacent. So the pair is A# #A. According to the first rule, this pair becomes nothing. But in the initial sequence, the second token is A# (from position 2) and third is #A (position 3). So the pair between positions 2 and 3 is A# followed by #A. That's a valid pair for the first rule (A# #A → nothing). Wait, but according to the problem statement, the first rule is "A# #A ... becomes ... nothing". So that pair should be replaced by nothing.

Wait, but the first two tokens are A# A#, and the next pair is A# (position 2) followed by #A (position 3). That's a pair that matches the first rule. So in the initial sequence, the first applicable pair is at positions 2 and 3 (A# and #A). Applying the first rule here would remove these two tokens.

Wait, but let's confirm. The initial sequence is:

1: A#

2: A#

3: #A

4: B#

5: B#

6: B#

7: A#

8: A#

9: #B

10: A#

So the first pairs are (1-2: A#, A#), which doesn't match any rule. Then pair 2-3: A#, #A. That's the first occurrence of a rule. So applying the first rule here: A# #A → nothing. So these two tokens are removed. The resulting sequence after this replacement would be:

Tokens 1 (A#) remains. Then tokens 4 to 10 (B#, B#, B#, A#, A#, #B, A#). Wait, no. Let me see: when we remove positions 2 and 3, the new sequence is:

1: A#, then followed by the tokens from position 4 onwards. So the sequence becomes:

A# (from 1), then B# (4), B# (5), B# (6), A# (7), A# (8), #B (9), A# (10).

So the new sequence is [A#, B#, B#, B#, A#, A#, #B, A#]. Let's count the length: original was 10 tokens. After removing two, it's 8.

Now, we need to restart processing from the beginning.

New sequence: A#, B#, B#, B#, A#, A#, #B, A#.

Check pairs again from the left:

First pair: A# (1) followed by B# (2). The adjacent sides are # (from A#) and B (from B#). So they are A# B#, which is not a matching rule. The rules for A# followed by #B are the second rule. But here, the next token is B#, which is B followed by #. So the adjacent pair is # (from A#) and B (from B#). So this doesn't match any of the rules. So no replacement here.

Next pair: B# (2) and B# (3). Their adjacent sides are # (from B#) and B (from next B#). So they are B# B#, which is not a match. Rules apply only when the #s are facing. So B# followed by #B would match the fourth rule. But here, B# followed by B# is # and B, which don't face.

Next pair: B# (3) and B# (4). Same as above, no match.

Then B# (4) followed by A# (5). The adjacent sides are # (from B#) and A (from A#). So B# A#. The pair is B# followed by A#, which is # and A. The third rule is B# #A → swap to #A B#. But here, the next token after B# is A#, which is A followed by #. So the adjacent sides are # (from B#) and A (from A#). So that's B# followed by A#, which is not matching any rule. So no replacement here.

Next pair: A# (5) followed by A# (6). Adjacent sides are # and A. No rule applies.

Then A# (6) followed by #B (7). The adjacent sides are # (from A#) and # (from #B). Wait, A# is [A][#], so the right side is #. #B is [#][B], so the left side is #. So the pair is A# #B. According to the second rule, this becomes #B A#. So this pair (positions 6 and 7 in the current sequence) would be replaced.

Wait, let's clarify the current sequence after the first replacement:

The current sequence is:

1: A#

2: B#

3: B#

4: B#

5: A#

6: A#

7: #B

8: A#

So the pair at positions 5 and 6: A# followed by A#, adjacent sides are # and A. Not a match. Then pair 6 and 7: A# (position 6) followed by #B (position 7). That's A# #B → replace with #B A#. So applying this rule.

After replacement, the tokens at positions 6 and 7 are replaced by #B A#. So the new sequence becomes:

Positions 1-5: A#, B#, B#, B#, A#

Then the inserted #B, A# (from replacing positions 6 and 7), followed by the remaining token at position 8: A#.

So the new sequence is: A#, B#, B#, B#, A#, #B, A#, A#.

Wait, let me verify. Original sequence after first replacement had 8 tokens:

1: A#

2: B#

3: B#

4: B#

5: A#

6: A#

7: #B

8: A#

Replacing positions 6 and 7 (A# and #B) with #B A#, so those two tokens are removed and replaced by #B and A#. So the new sequence is:

1: A#

2: B#

3: B#

4: B#

5: A#

6: #B

7: A#

8: A#

Now, the sequence has 8 tokens again? Wait, no. Original positions 6-7 are two tokens. Replaced by two tokens. So the length remains the same. But the problem's example shows that replacing two tokens with two others (like in the first step of the example, replacing two tokens with two others). But in some rules, like the first and fourth, the pair is replaced by nothing, so length decreases by two.

So in this case, the pair A# #B (two tokens) is replaced by #B A# (two tokens). So the total number of tokens remains 8.

So the new sequence after this replacement is:

[A#, B#, B#, B#, A#, #B, A#, A#]

Now, we need to restart processing from the beginning.

Check pairs again:

First pair: A# (1) and B# (2). Adjacent sides: # and B. Not a rule.

Next pair: B# (2) and B# (3). Adjacent sides: # and B. No rule.

Next pair: B# (3) and B# (4). Same as above.

Next pair: B# (4) and A# (5). Adjacent sides: # and A. B# followed by A#. The third rule is B# followed by #A → swap to #A B#. But here, the next token is A#, which is A followed by #. So adjacent sides are # (from B#) and A (from A#). So that's B# followed by A#, which does not match any rule. So no replacement.

Next pair: A# (5) and #B (6). Adjacent sides: # (from A#) and # (from #B). So the pair is A# #B. This is the second rule, which says replace with #B A#. So this pair (positions 5 and 6) is replaced by #B A#. Let's apply that.

After replacing positions 5 and 6 (A# and #B) with #B A#, the sequence becomes:

1: A#, B#, B#, B#, #B, A#, A#, A#.

Wait, the original sequence up to position 4 was B#, then position 5 is A#, 6 is #B, 7 is A#, 8 is A#. So replacing positions 5 and 6 (A# and #B) with #B and A#, the new sequence is:

Positions 1-4: A#, B#, B#, B#

Then #B (from replacement), A#, then the previous 7 and 8: A#, A#. So the sequence becomes:

[A#, B#, B#, B#, #B, A#, A#, A#]

Now, we restart processing from the beginning.

First pair: A# (1) and B# (2). # and B: no rule.

Next: B# (2) and B# (3): # and B: no.

Next: B# (3) and B# (4): same.

Next: B# (4) and #B (5): B# followed by #B. The fourth rule says B# #B → nothing. So this pair (positions 4 and 5) is replaced by nothing. So removing these two tokens.

The new sequence after this replacement is:

Tokens 1-3: A#, B#, B#

Then the remaining tokens after position 5 are A#, A#, A#. So the new sequence is:

[A#, B#, B#, A#, A#, A#]

Length is 6.

Now, restart processing from the beginning.

Check pairs:

First pair: A# (1) and B# (2). # and B: no.

Next: B# (2) and B# (3): # and B: no.

Next: B# (3) and A# (4): # and A. B# followed by A#: adjacent # (from B#) and A (from A#). No rule applies here.

Next: A# (4) and A# (5): # and A: no.

Next: A# (5) and A# (6): same as above.

So no applicable pairs. Is the process done here? Let me check.

Wait, wait. So the current sequence is [A#, B#, B#, A#, A#, A#]. Are there any possible pairs that can be replaced?

Looking at each adjacent pair:

1-2: A# B# → no.

2-3: B# B# → no.

3-4: B# A# → adjacent # (from B#) and A (from A#) → no rule.

4-5: A# A# → # and A → no.

5-6: A# A# → same.

So no rules apply. So the final result is this sequence. But wait, the initial problem's example ended with B#. Let me recheck to see if I missed any steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the processing. Let me retrace.

After the previous step where we had [A#, B#, B#, #B, A#, A#, A#], then we replaced B# (4) and #B (5) with nothing, leading to [A#, B#, B#, A#, A#, A#]. Then processing this sequence again.

But wait, maybe there's another possible pair in the earlier steps.

Alternatively, let's check whether there was any other possible pair that could have been processed earlier.

Wait, let's re-examine the previous steps.

After the replacement of B# and #B into nothing, the new sequence is [A#, B#, B#, A#, A#, A#].

Now, processing from the beginning:

A# followed by B# (positions 1-2): no.

B# followed by B# (2-3): B# and B#, adjacent # and B. No rule.

B# (3) followed by A# (4): B# A# → adjacent # and A. No rule.

A# (4) followed by A# (5): # and A → no.

A# (5) followed by A# (6): same.

So no rules apply. Thus, this is the final sequence.

Wait, but the answer expected here may be different. Let me check my steps again to ensure I didn't make a mistake.

Let me go back through the entire process step by step again to verify.

Original program: A# A# #A B# B# B# A# A# #B A#

Breaking into tokens:

1: A#

2: A#

3: #A

4: B#

5: B#

6: B#

7: A#

8: A#

9: #B

10: A#

Step 1: Processing the initial sequence.

Looking for the first applicable pair:

Check pair 1-2: A# followed by A# → no.

Pair 2-3: A# followed by #A → this matches the first rule (A# #A → nothing). So replace them.

Resulting sequence after removing positions 2 and 3:

1: A#

Then followed by B# (4), B# (5), B# (6), A# (7), A# (8), #B (9), A# (10).

So the new sequence is:

[A#, B#, B#, B#, A#, A#, #B, A#]

Length 8.

Step 2: Process this new sequence.

Check pairs:

1-2: A# B# → no.

2-3: B# B# → no.

3-4: B# B# → no.

4-5: B# A# → adjacent # and A → no.

5-6: A# A# → no.

6-7: A# #B → this pair (positions 6 and 7) is A# followed by #B → replace with #B A# (rule 2).

So replace positions 6 and 7 with #B A#.

New sequence:

[A#, B#, B#, B#, A#, #B, A#, A#]

Length remains 8.

Step 3: Process this new sequence.

Check pairs:

1-2: A# B# → no.

2-3: B# B# → no.

3-4: B# B# → no.

4-5: B# A# → no.

5-6: A# #B → replace with #B A# (rule 2).

So positions 5-6 (A# and #B) become #B A#. New sequence:

[A#, B#, B#, B#, #B, A#, A#, A#]

Step 4: Process this sequence.

Check pairs:

1-2: A# B# → no.

2-3: B# B# → no.

3-4: B# B# → no.

4-5: B# #B → this matches rule 4 (B# #B → nothing). So remove them.

Resulting sequence:

[A#, B#, B#, A#, A#, A#]

Length 6.

Step 5: Process this sequence.

Check pairs:

No applicable pairs. So this is the final result.

But wait, the sequence is [A#, B#, B#, A#, A#, A#]. Are there any possible reductions here?

Wait, let's check again. A# is at positions 1, 4, 5, 6. B# at 2 and 3.

Pairs:

1-2: A# B# → no.

2-3: B# B# → no.

3-4: B# A# → adjacent # (from B#) and A (from A#) → no rule.

4-5: A# A# → no.

5-6: A# A# → no.

So yes, no further reductions. So the final state is A# B# B# A# A# A#.

But wait, let's check once more to see if any steps were missed.

Alternative approach: maybe after the step where we had [A#, B#, B#, #B, A#, A#, A#], when replacing B# and #B to nothing, perhaps another pair could form.

Wait, in that step, the sequence was:

A#, B#, B#, B#, #B, A#, A#, A# → after replacing positions 4 and 5 (B# and #B), we get [A#, B#, B#, A#, A#, A#].

Then, in this new sequence, are there any other pairs to process?

Hmm. Let me think if during the processing of this new sequence, there's a pair I missed.

Wait, perhaps after that step, the next sequence is [A#, B#, B#, A#, A#, A#]. Are there any possible pairs here that can be processed? For example, between B# and A#?

B# (position 3) and A# (position 4): B# followed by A#. Adjacent sides are # (from B#) and A (from A#). Which doesn't match any rule. The third rule is B# followed by #A → which would swap to #A B#. But here, the A# is A followed by #, so the adjacent side is A. So no rule applies.

So the sequence remains.

Therefore, the final answer is A# B# B# A# A# A#?

Wait, but that seems a bit long, and maybe there's a step I missed.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the step where I replaced A# #B with #B A#. Let's re-examine that.

Original step after the first replacement: sequence is [A#, B#, B#, B#, A#, A#, #B, A#].

Then, in step 2, we process the pairs. The pair at positions 6-7 is A# followed by #B. Replacing them with #B A# gives [A#, B#, B#, B#, A#, #B, A#, A#].

Wait, but after this replacement, the next step is processing the new sequence. Let me check the next step again.

In the new sequence, [A#, B#, B#, B#, A#, #B, A#, A#], the pair at positions 5-6 is A# and #B. Replacing them gives #B A#. So the sequence becomes [A#, B#, B#, B#, #B, A#, A#, A#].

Then, processing that sequence, we look for pairs. The pair B# (position 4) and #B (position 5) is B# followed by #B. Which matches rule 4 → removed. So after removing positions 4 and 5, the sequence becomes [A#, B#, B#, A#, A#, A#].

Now, in this sequence, are there any pairs that can be processed?

A# (position 1) followed by B# (2): no.

B# (2) followed by B# (3): no.

B# (3) followed by A# (4): no.

A# (4) followed by A# (5): no.

A# (5) followed by A# (6): no.

No further rules can be applied. So the final sequence is A# B# B# A# A# A#.

But this seems to have 6 tokens. However, the example in the problem had a program that reduced to B#. But perhaps in this case, this is the correct result.

Wait, but perhaps I missed a step where after removing B# #B, there's a new adjacent pair formed.

For example, when we remove B# (position4) and #B (position5), the tokens after them are A#, A#, A#. So after removal, the sequence is:

A#, B#, B#, A#, A#, A#.

In this sequence, positions 3-4 are B# followed by A#. B# (position3) is followed by A# (position4). The adjacent sides are # (from B#) and A (from A#). No rule applies here.

So yes, no further steps.

But wait, what if after the removal of positions 4 and 5, the sequence becomes A#, B#, B#, A#, A#, A#. Let me check if there's any other possible pair.

Another possibility is that after removing B# #B, the tokens before and after could form a new pair. For example, in the sequence after removal, the tokens are:

1: A#, 2: B#, 3: B#, 4: A#, 5: A#, 6: A#.

So after B# (3) is A# (4). As before, no rule applies.

But maybe I made a mistake in earlier steps. Let's try to process the original sequence again.

Alternative approach: maybe after the first replacement, when positions 2-3 are removed, leading to:

[A#, B#, B#, B#, A#, A#, #B, A#]

Then, when processing this sequence, perhaps there's an earlier applicable pair that I didn't notice.

Wait, for example, maybe in the sequence [A#, B#, B#, B#, A#, A#, #B, A#], the pair B# B# B# could have B# B# pairs.

But according to the rules, we process the leftmost applicable pair first.

So after the first replacement, the sequence is:

A#, B#, B#, B#, A#, A#, #B, A#.

Looking for the leftmost applicable pair.

Check pairs:

1-2: A# B# → no.

2-3: B# B# → no.

3-4: B# B# → no.

4-5: B# A# → no.

5-6: A# A# → no.

6-7: A# #B → yes. Replace with #B A#.

So that's correct.

So after replacing positions 6-7 with #B A#, the sequence becomes:

A#, B#, B#, B#, A#, #B, A#, A#.

Then, processing this sequence:

Check pairs left to right.

1-2: A# B# → no.

2-3: B# B# → no.

3-4: B# B# → no.

4-5: B# A# → no.

5-6: A# #B → replace with #B A#.

So new sequence: A#, B#, B#, B#, #B, A#, A#, A#.

Processing this:

1-2: A# B# → no.

2-3: B# B# → no.

3-4: B# B# → no.

4-5: B# #B → replace with nothing. So removing positions 4-5.

New sequence: A#, B#, B#, A#, A#, A#.

Now, no applicable pairs.

So the final result is A# B# B# A# A# A#.

But wait, this seems to leave several tokens. Did I make a mistake in the processing?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a pair in the final sequence that I'm missing. Let me re-examine the final sequence: A#, B#, B#, A#, A#, A#.

Looking for any possible pairs:

A# followed by B#: no.

B# followed by B#: no.

B# followed by A#: no.

A# followed by A#: no.

So yes, no applicable rules.

But according to the example in the problem, the program can reduce to a single token. Is this a different case where multiple tokens remain?

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the steps.

Let me try another approach by writing down all the steps more systematically.

Original program:

A# A# #A B# B# B# A# A# #B A#

Let's list the tokens with indices:

1: A#

2: A#

3: #A

4: B#

5: B#

6: B#

7: A#

8: A#

9: #B

10: A#

Step 1: Look for the first applicable pair.

Check pairs 1-2: A# followed by A#. No.

Pair 2-3: A# followed by #A. Yes, rule 1: replace with nothing.

Remove tokens 2 and 3. New sequence:

1: A#

4: B#

5: B#

6: B#

7: A#

8: A#

9: #B

10: A#

Now, the tokens are:

[A#, B#, B#, B#, A#, A#, #B, A#]

Indices 1-8.

Step 2: Process from start.

Pair 1-2: A# followed by B#. No.

Pair 2-3: B# followed by B#. No.

Pair 3-4: B# followed by B#. No.

Pair 4-5: B# followed by A#. No.

Pair 5-6: A# followed by A#. No.

Pair 6-7: A# followed by #B. Yes, rule 2: replace with #B A#.

Replace tokens 6 and 7 (#B is token 9 in original, but now in the current sequence, token 6 is A# and token7 is #B. So replace them with #B A#. So the new sequence becomes:

[A#, B#, B#, B#, A#, #B, A#, A#]

Step 3: Process this sequence.

Pair 1-2: A# B#. No.

Pair 2-3: B# B#. No.

Pair 3-4: B# B#. No.

Pair 4-5: B# A#. No.

Pair 5-6: A# #B. Yes, rule 2: replace with #B A#.

Replace tokens 5 and 6. New sequence:

[A#, B#, B#, B#, #B, A#, A#, A#]

Step 4: Process this sequence.

Pair 1-2: A# B#. No.

Pair 2-3: B# B#. No.

Pair 3-4: B# B#. No.

Pair 4-5: B# #B. Yes, rule4: replace with nothing.

Remove tokens 4 and 5. New sequence:

[A#, B#, B#, A#, A#, A#]

Step 5: Process this sequence.

No applicable pairs. So this is the final result.

So the final state is A# B# B# A# A# A#.

But this seems to be the case. However, I'm a bit unsure because the example reduced to a single token. But each program may reduce differently based on the rules and initial sequence.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial steps. Let me try to see if there's another way the rules could be applied.

Another approach: perhaps after the first replacement, when the sequence is [A#, B#, B#, B#, A#, A#, #B, A#], maybe there's another pair that can be processed before the pair at positions 6-7.

For example, after the first step, the sequence is:

A#, B#, B#, B#, A#, A#, #B, A#.

In this sequence, perhaps pair 4-5: B# followed by A#. But rule3 says B# #A → swap to #A B#. But the next token after B# is A#, which is A followed by #. So the adjacent pair is B# (with # on the right) and A# (with A on the left). So the adjacent pair is # and A. No rule applies here.

But wait, B# followed by A#: the B# has a # on the right, and the A# has an A on the left. So they are not facing each other. So no rule applies.

So no other pairs except the one at positions 6-7.

Thus, the processing steps seem correct.

Therefore, the final answer should be the sequence A# B# B# A# A# A#, which is written as "A# B# B# A# A# A#".

But wait, perhaps there's a step where after removing B# #B, the new sequence has a pair that can be processed.

Let me check the final sequence after step 4: [A#, B#, B#, A#, A#, A#].

Looking for any possible pairs:

Pair 3-4: B# followed by A#. The adjacent sides are # (B#) and A (A#). No rule applies.

Pair 4-5: A# followed by A#. No.

So no rules apply.

Thus, the final state is indeed six tokens: A# B# B# A# A# A#.</think>
<answer>A# B# B# A# A# A#</answer>"""

score_answer = ScoreAnswer()
score = score_answer.score_answer(answer, entry, task)
print(score)


response = requests.post("http://localhost:8288/score", json={"answer": answer, "entry": entry, "task": task})
print(response.json())
